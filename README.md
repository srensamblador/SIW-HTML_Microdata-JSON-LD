# HTML Microdata
Took a random news article from a national newspaper and tagged it semantically with HTML Microdata, using Schema.org as the ontology of choice.

Used OpenCalais to find a list of potential entities and Google Structured Data Testing Tool to validate the Microdata.

# JSON-LD
Worked with JSON-LD to semantically tag a given text. Once again used Google Structured Data Testing Tool to validate it.
